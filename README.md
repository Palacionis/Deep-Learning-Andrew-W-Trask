# Deep-Learning-Andrew-W-Trask
Deep Learning code from 2018 book 'Deep Learning' by Andrew W Trask
This book covers what I have been wanting to learn after using Tensorflow and other deep learning frameworks - what actually happens 
The code in this book only uses mainly numpy library to build deep neural network framework
