# Deep-Learning-Andrew-W-Trask
Deep Learning code from 2018 book 'Deep Learning' by Andrew W Trask

This book covers what I have been wanting to learn after playing around with Tensorflow and other deep learning frameworks - what actually happens behind the scenes and what is the logic and math behind it. Andrew covers it and many more interesting topics flawlessly.

The code in this book only uses mainly numpy library to build deep neural network framework which makes it easier to follow and actually understand how backpropagation / forwardpropagation / RNN works
